== Purpose
This lab will introduce you into one of the many ways to develop a Sensor for
an Internet of Things scenario.

In this scenario we will be using the following hardware:

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266[ESP6288] Microprocessor, mounted on a
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU[NodeMCU]
 * https://www.adafruit.com/product/385[DHT22] sensor for temperature and humidity
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard[Breadboard] for rapid hardware "prototyping"
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors[USB-Kable] to connect the NodeMCU with your desktop
 * PC running Linux Desktop, Windows or MacOSX

[NOTE]
====
Participants in this lab are expected to have a general understanding of at least
one programming language, so that our source-examples do not need to be documented
line-by-line.
====

== Development environment
To be able to follow the Labs you will need to install the following software on your
desktop

 * https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]
 * https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers[Serial to USB Driver]

Please make sure you have the right version for your desktop Operating system
downloaded and installed.

== Lab 1: Simple ESP8266 Program

=== Learnings
In this lab we will be getting acquainted with

 * writing a program for the ESP8266
 * flashing the program on the ESP8266

=== Hardware Setup
This lab will be very minimal on hardware. All you need is

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266[ESP6288] Microprocessor, mounted on a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU[NodeMCU]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard[Breadboard] for rapid hardware "prototyping"

Place your ESP8266 on the Breadboard, as shown in the picture

image:1.ESP_Only/images/breadboard.png[]

Connect the Micro-USB port of the NodeMCU with your desktop.

=== Software Setup
Please start your already installed https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE].

You will have to add capabilities for the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE] to be able to build
and flash code for our ESP8266.

 * Open the preferences window from the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]. Go to `File -> Preferences`
 * Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field and click the `OK` button

image:1.ESP_Only/images/Arduino-IDE-preferences.png[]

 * Open boards manager. Go to `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager…`

image:1.ESP_Only/images/Arduino-IDE-boards-manager.png[]

 * Scroll down, select the ESP8266 board menu and install `esp8266 platform`

image:1.ESP_Only/images/installing-esp-board.png[]

 * Re-Start your https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]

Now that we have the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE] prepared to
interact with your ESP8266, we only need to configure it accordingly.

 * Open the `Tools` menu and configure the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]
 according to the following table

[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|============
|Parameter    |Value
|CPU Frequency | 80
|Flash Size | 4M (1M SPIFFS)
|Upload Speed |115200
|Port | <your USB-2-Serial port>
|============

=== Source-Code
Please transfer ( copy/paste, re-type, ... ) the following code on into your
https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]

[source,c++]
----
 String        message = "";      // message to display

 /* Functionname says it all! */
 void setup(void) {

   Serial.begin(115200);          // prepare serial for debug messages

   Serial.println("\n\rESP8266 started!");
 }

 /* Functionname says it all! */
 void loop(void) {
  message = "\n\rStill working";
  Serial.print(message);
  delay(1000);                    // Sleep a second
 }
----

=== Flashing the ESP8266
With the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE] installed and configured
and our code ( hopefully correctly ) transfered, the last step we need to take is to
flash the code onto the ESP8266.

To do this, please push the 'Flash' Button on the NodeMCU

image:1.ESP_Only/images/flash_ESP.png[]

this will reset the ESP8266 and will bring him into a mode where he expects a new
image to be flashed.

Build and flash the code via the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]

image:1.ESP_Only/images/build_and_flash.png[]

Once the flash process has completed, the ESP8266 will restart and will automatically
start the new code.

In our code we did write some statements via `Serial.println();``. To view these,
please open the Serial Monitor via the menu `Tools->Serial Monitor` and make sure
you have the same Baud-Rate configured as in the previous steps for the `Upload Speed`


=== Expected Outcome
Our code runs a simple endless-loop which write `Still working` with a 1 second
delay to the Serial output.

== Lab 2: Blink

=== Learnings
As a first extension to our simple Program, we will introduce a way to let the
ESP8266 communicate with you. To make this "communication" simple, we will be
using a LED, which is already part of the NodeMCU board.

=== Hardware Setup
Same as in previous Lab

=== Software Setup
Same as in previous Lab

=== Source-Code
To not loose our previous code, please open a new "sketch" in your https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE]
by selecting the menu `File->New`

Please transfer ( copy/paste, re-type, ... ) the following code

[source,c++]
----
String        message = "";

/************* Functionname says it all! ******************************/
void setup(void) {

  Serial.begin(115200);

  Serial.println("\n\rESP8266 started!");

  pinMode(BUILTIN_LED, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the BUILTIN_LED pin as an output
}

/************* Functionname says it all! ******************************/
void loop(void) {

  message = "\n\rLight On";
  Serial.print(message);
  digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, LOW);
  delay(1000);

  message = "\n\rLight Off";
  Serial.print(message);
  digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
}
----

As you can see, there is only need for very slight adjustments to our previous
code. All we need to do is

 * `pinMode(BUILTIN_LED, OUTPUT);` define the GPIO as outbound
 * `digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, LOW);` send a LOW-Signale to the GPIO to turn on LED
 * `digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, HIGH);` send a HIGH-Signale to the GPIO to turn on LED

[NOTE]
====
General-purpose input/output (GPIO) is a generic pin on an integrated
circuit or computer board whose behavior—including whether it is an
input or output pin—is controllable by the user at run time.

=== Flashing the ESP8266
Same as in previous Lab

=== Outcome
As in the previous Lab, you can use the `Serial Monitor`to view the messages
written to the Serial port. In Addition you should see the LED on the NodeMCU
changing it's state from "on" to "off" every second.
